# ECHOPOD – ESP32 Ultrasonic Assistive Device

ECHOPOD is an indoor navigation assistive device designed for visually impaired users. It uses three ultrasonic sensors mounted at the front, left, and right to detect nearby obstacles and provides direction-wise vibration feedback using vibration motors.

## 🔧 Features
- Three ultrasonic sensors (Front, Left, Right)
- Directional vibration feedback
- Distance-based vibration frequency
- Faster vibration as obstacle comes closer
- Continuous vibration for very close objects
- Serial monitoring for debugging
- No buzzer (silent, vibration-only feedback)

## 🧠 Working Principle
Each ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to nearby obstacles.  
- If no obstacle is detected within range, the motor remains OFF.
- As an obstacle enters the warning range, the corresponding motor starts vibrating.
- The vibration frequency increases as the obstacle distance decreases.
- When the obstacle is very close, the motor vibrates continuously.

This step-less frequency change helps users intuitively judge how close an obstacle is.
